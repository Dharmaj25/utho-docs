## **What is a Virtual Machine?**

A virtual machine (VM) is an emulated computer. It runs on a physical host computer and simulates a separate operating system. Virtualization technology lets a physical server or computer run several VMs. Each VM acts like a separate computer with its own OS, apps, and resources. A VM creates a virtualized environment. Users can deploy OS setups, run apps, or test software in a contained system. This does not impact the host system.

## **Key Characteristics of a Virtual Machine:**

Each VM operates independently on the same host in an isolated environment. Tasks in one VM don't affect the others.

Dedicated Resources: VMs have allocated resources like CPU, memory, and storage. You can adjust them as needed.

Multiple Operating Systems: VMs can run different OSs (e.g., Windows, Linux, macOS) on a single host. This makes them ideal for development and testing.

VMs are useful when multiple environments are needed. This includes development, testing, or running apps that require specific OSs.

## **How Does a Virtual Machine Work?**

Virtual machines use virtualization to create multiple, independent environments on one physical machine. Virtualization software, called a hypervisor, manages VMs. It allocates resources and ensures isolation between each virtual environment.

## **Steps in Virtual Machine Operation:**

Installing a Hypervisor: It is essential software. It allows multiple VMs to coexist on a single host. There are two main types of hypervisors:

**Type 1 (Bare-Metal Hypervisor):** It installs directly on the host hardware, without an OS. Examples include VMware ESXi, Microsoft Hyper-V, and Xen.

**Type 2 (Hosted Hypervisor):** Runs on top of the host OS, creating VMs as applications. Examples include VMware Workstation, Oracle VirtualBox, and Parallels.

**Resource Allocation:** The hypervisor divides the host's resources (CPU, memory, storage) among the VMs. Each VM is assigned specific resources, which can be adjusted based on its needs. This allocation ensures that each VM operates as if it were a standalone computer.

**Creation of a Virtual Disk:** A virtual disk stores the VM's data, apps, and OS files. This disk acts as a storage device, just like a physical hard drive in a computer.

**OS Installation in VM:** After setting up the VM, an OS can be installed in the virtual environment. Users can install any compatible OS, effectively creating a separate “computer” within the VM.

**Independent Operation:** The VM now works as an isolated environment. Users can install apps, configure settings, and run processes. This won't affect the host or other VMs.

## **How Virtual Machines Operate in Isolation**

The hypervisor ensures each VM operates independently. It isolates memory, storage, and processing from other VMs. This isolation is crucial for security and stability. It prevents issues in one VM from affecting others. The hypervisor also manages the VMs’ resource allocation. It ensures efficient use of the host’s hardware.

This technology lets users deploy many VMs on a single host. Each VM can run different tasks, OSs, or apps in isolated, virtualized environments.
