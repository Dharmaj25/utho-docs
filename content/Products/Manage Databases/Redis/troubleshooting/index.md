This section provides solutions to common issues users may encounter while using our Redis service. If you encounter problems, follow these steps to resolve them or contact our support team for assistance.

<!-- # Troubleshooting Guide for MySQL Database Product -->

## Common Issues

# Troubleshooting Redis in UTHO
## 1. Connection Issues
### Symptoms:
- Unable to connect to the Redis instance.
- Connection timeouts.
### Solutions:
- **Check Network Settings:** Ensure that your Redis instance's network settings allow connections from your clientâ€™s IP address.
- **Verify Security Groups and Firewall Rules:** Confirm that the appropriate ports (default is 6379) are open and accessible from trusted IP addresses.
- **Check Redis Logs:** Examine the Redis logs for any error messages or connection issues.
- **Authentication:** Ensure that you are using the correct password if authentication is enabled.
## 2. Performance Issues
### Symptoms:
- Slow response times.
- High latency for Redis commands.
### Solutions:
- **Monitor Metrics:** Use the UTHO console or third-party tools to monitor Redis performance metrics such as CPU usage, memory usage, and command execution times.
- **Optimize Data Structures:** Review and optimize the data structures and commands used in your application to reduce processing time.
- **Review Slow Log Entries:** Use the Redis `SLOWLOG` command to identify slow-running commands and optimize them.
- **Increase Resources:** Scale your Redis instance vertically by increasing CPU and memory, or horizontally by adding more nodes to a Redis cluster.
## 3. Memory Issues
### Symptoms:
- Redis instance running out of memory.
- Frequent evictions or out-of-memory errors.
### Solutions:
- **Adjust Memory Settings:** Configure the `maxmemory` setting in Redis to control the maximum amount of memory Redis can use.
- **Eviction Policies:** Choose an appropriate eviction policy (e.g., `volatile-lru`, `allkeys-lru`) based on your use case to manage memory usage.
- **Monitor Memory Usage:** Continuously monitor memory usage using the UTHO console or third-party monitoring tools.
- **Optimize Data Storage:** Review the data stored in Redis and remove unnecessary or expired data.
## 4. Data Persistence Issues
### Symptoms:
- Data loss after a restart.
- Persistence errors in logs.
### Solutions:
- **Verify Persistence Configurations:** Ensure that the appropriate persistence mechanisms (RDB, AOF, or both) are enabled and configured correctly in the Redis configuration file.
- **Check Redis Logs:** Examine the Redis logs for any errors related to persistence.
- **Disk Space:** Ensure that there is sufficient disk space available for Redis to write snapshots and AOF files.
- **Backup and Restore:** Regularly back up your Redis data and test the restore process to ensure data integrity.
## 5. Replication Issues
### Symptoms:
- Replication lag.
- Replica nodes not syncing with the master.
### Solutions:
- **Check Network Latency:** Ensure low network latency between master and replica nodes to reduce replication lag.
- **Monitor Replica Status:** Use the `INFO replication` command to monitor the status of replica nodes and check for any issues.
- **Configuration:** Verify that the replica configuration is correct and that the replica nodes can connect to the master.
- **Disk Space:** Ensure sufficient disk space on replica nodes to handle the data being replicated.
## 6. Failover and High Availability Issues
### Symptoms:
- Failover not occurring as expected.
- Redis Sentinel not promoting a new master.
### Solutions:
- **Redis Sentinel Configuration:** Ensure that Redis Sentinel is correctly configured with accurate information about the master and replica nodes.
- **Monitor Sentinel Logs:** Check the Sentinel logs for any errors or warnings that could indicate issues with failover.
- **Network Connectivity:** Ensure reliable network connectivity between Sentinel instances and Redis nodes.
- **Quorum and Majority:** Ensure that the Sentinel configuration meets the quorum requirements for automatic failover to occur.
