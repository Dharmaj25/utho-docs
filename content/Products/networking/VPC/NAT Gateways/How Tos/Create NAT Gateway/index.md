### **4. Configure the NAT Gateway**

In the configuration drawer, you'll be prompted to provide the following information for the new NAT Gateway:

1. **Name** :

* This field allows you to provide a **name** for your NAT Gateway. It is used to uniquely identify the gateway within your account and helps you manage and reference it later.

2. **Subnet** :

* This is a **dropdown** menu where you can select the **subnet** to which the NAT Gateway will be attached. Only available subnets will be shown here, and you can choose one based on the location and configuration of your resources.

3. **Elastic IP Allocation ID** :

* This dropdown allows you to select an **Elastic IP** that has been allocated previously. If there are no Elastic IPs available, a button labeled **"Allocate IP"** will be shown next to the dropdown. Clicking on this button will generate and allocate a new Elastic IP for the NAT Gateway, which will then be available for selection in the dropdown.
