### **VPC Information**

1. **Name of the VPC** :

* The **name** displayed is the identifier of the VPC. It is set during the VPC deployment and is used to easily reference and manage the VPC in the cloud environment.

2. **DC Location of the VPC** :

* This indicates the **data center (DC) location** where the VPC has been deployed. It helps determine the geographical region of the VPC and its associated resources.

3. **VPC Range** :

* The **VPC range** shows the IP address range allocated to the VPC. It is used to manage and allocate IP addresses to various resources within the VPC.

4. **IP of the VPC** :

* This is the **primary IP address** assigned to the VPC. It represents the main network address for routing within the VPC.

5. **Status of the VPC** :

* The **status** indicates whether the VPC is **active** or not. If the status is "Running," the VPC is actively serving the resources and is in use.

### **Tabs for Further Configuration**

1. **Resources Tab** :

* This tab displays a list of all the **resources** (like cloud servers, load balancers, etc.) attached to the VPC. It provides a comprehensive view of the VPC's active resources.

2. **Subnet Tab** :

* The **Subnet** tab lists all the subnets within the VPC. It also provides the option to **create new subnets** for more fine-grained network management within the VPC.

3. **Destroy VPC Tab** :

* The **Destroy VPC** tab contains the option to **permanently destroy the VPC** and all associated resources. This option is available only after confirming the VPC name for safety.
