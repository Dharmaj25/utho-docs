## **Overview of Firewalls in Utho Cloud Platform**

A **Firewall** in the Utho Cloud Platform is a security feature designed to control incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It acts as a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external networks, preventing unauthorized access while allowing legitimate communication.

### **Common Uses of Firewalls**

* **Network Security:** Firewalls are used to secure cloud resources by filtering traffic and allowing or blocking communication based on security rules.
* **Access Control:** They help manage access to specific cloud resources, ensuring that only authorized users or applications can connect.
* **Protecting Virtual Machines:** By configuring firewalls, users can protect virtual machines from malicious attacks and unauthorized access.
* **Traffic Filtering:** Firewalls inspect traffic for malicious content and block harmful requests to safeguard cloud infrastructure.
* **Remote Access Control:** Firewalls can be used to manage and restrict remote access to cloud services, ensuring secure connections from trusted networks.
