### **Overview Section (Performance Metrics)** :

* **CPU Usage** : Tracks the percentage of CPU being utilized, helping to assess the load on the system.
* **Memory Usage** : Monitors RAM consumption to ensure the system has enough resources for optimal performance.
* **Network Traffic** : Measures the incoming and outgoing data flow, indicating potential network congestion or resource needs.
* **Network Packets** : Counts the data packets sent and received, helping to analyze network efficiency and activity.
* **Disk Read/Write** : Measures the amount of data being read from and written to the disk, indicating disk performance.
* **Power** : Controls the on/off state of cloud instances. Powering on or off affects instance availability.
* **Network** : Manages connectivity, IP addresses, and security groups, ensuring proper communication between instances.
* **Storage** : Refers to the allocation and management of persistent data storage (e.g., volumes, disks) for cloud instances.
* **Resize** : Allows modification of cloud instance resources (CPU, memory) to meet changing performance demands.
* **Rebuild** : Restores a cloud instance to its initial configuration or a snapshot, often used to fix issues or reset the system.
* **Firewall** : Configures rules to control incoming and outgoing network traffic to protect cloud instances from unauthorized access.
* **ISO** : Uses ISO image files to install or boot an operating system, providing flexibility for custom OS installations.
* **Billing** : Tracks usage and costs associated with cloud resources, providing financial visibility and helping manage cloud expenses.
* **Backup** : Creates copies of cloud instances or data to ensure recovery in case of failure or data loss.
* **Snapshot** : Captures a point-in-time image of an instanceâ€™s state (including OS, disk, and configurations) for easy recovery or cloning.
* **Destroy** : Deletes cloud instances and their associated resources, freeing up space and reducing costs when no longer needed.
