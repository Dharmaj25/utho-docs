### **What is  Cloud?**

A **cloud instance** is a virtual server or computing resource that runs in a cloud environment. It’s essentially a "virtual machine" (VM) in the cloud that can be used to run applications, store data, and perform other computing tasks. 

A cloud instance can be created and configured to meet specific requirements, such as CPU power, memory (RAM), storage capacity, and networking. It is a key component in  **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** , where users rent or lease computing resources instead of owning physical hardware.

**Utho Cloud** is a cloud computing provider offering a wide range of cloud services designed to help businesses, developers, and individuals move to the cloud and scale their operations with flexibility and ease. Utho Cloud provides a robust suite of services including **Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and **serverless computing**, to name a few.
