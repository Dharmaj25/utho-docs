![1744089497617](image/index/1744089497617.png)Powers off the cloud instance. This is a graceful shutdown process that allows all running applications and processes to close properly, minimizing the risk of data corruption.

Powering off a server offers several benefits:

1. **Cost Savings** : Reduces cloud costs by stopping resource usage (e.g., compute power, storage).
2. **Security** : Prevents unauthorized access or attacks when the server is not in use.
3. **Maintenance** : Allows for system updates, hardware troubleshooting, or backup tasks without running processes.
