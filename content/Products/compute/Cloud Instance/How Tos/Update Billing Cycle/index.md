Utho provides transparent billing details and options to manage your cloud server's billing cycle and costs effectively.![1718871902028](image/index/1718871902028.png)

### Billing Cycle

A **billing cycle** is the period of time between two consecutive billings for a service or subscription. In the context of cloud services, it refers to the recurring time frame (e.g., monthly, quarterly, or annually) for which usage is measured and billed.

The billing section displays current billing cycle details:

* **Current Billing Cycle**
* **Discount**

### Costs Breakdown

The breakdown of costs associated with your cloud server includes:

* **Total Cost:**   Total Cost refers to the overall expense incurred for using a service or product over a specific period. In the context of cloud services, it includes all charges for resources like compute, storage, bandwidth, and additional services. Itâ€™s the sum of all individual costs associated with running your infrastructure in the cloud.
* **OS Cost:** OS Cost refers to the charges associated with the operating system (OS) running on a virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. Some cloud providers charge extra for licensing specific operating systems (like Windows or certain enterprise Linux distributions). For example, Windows Server typically comes with additional licensing costs compared to Linux distributions, which are often free
* **Cloud Cost:** Cloud Cost refers to the overall expenditure related to using cloud services, including compute power, storage, networking, and other resources provided by cloud platforms (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud). Cloud cost can include:
* **Compute charges** (based on virtual machines or instances)
* **Storage costs** (for databases, file storage, backups)
* **Data transfer fees** (for inbound and outbound traffic)
* **Additional services** (such as load balancers, security, and monitoring tools)
* **Backup Cost:** Backup costs refer to the expenses of storing and managing data backups in the cloud. These costs depend on factors like storage type (e.g., standard vs. archival),  data volume ,  backup frequency , and  retention period . Cloud providers charge for the amount of storage used and may offer different pricing for faster or slower access. Additional costs can come from managed backup services and features like encryption or monitoring. Optimizing backup strategies can help reduce unnecessary costs.

### Additional Charges

* **18% GST** : GST will be applied extra to the total cost.

### Available Billing Cycles

Users can view and select from available billing cycles for their cloud server:![1718871915328](image/index/1718871915328.png)

* **Change Billing Cycle** : Clicking this option generates an invoice for the new billing cycle. Once paid, the cloud server's billing cycle will be updated accordingly.

### Workflow

1. **Review Current Cycle** : Check the current billing cycle and associated costs.
2. **Select New Cycle** : Choose a different billing cycle from the available options.
3. **Generate Invoice** : Click "Change Billing Cycle" to receive an invoice for the new cycle.
4. **Payment** : Once the invoice is received, proceed to make the payment to update the billing cycle.

Utho's billing features ensure clarity and flexibility in managing cloud server costs, accommodating various billing preferences efficiently.
