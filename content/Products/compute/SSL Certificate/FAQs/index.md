# FAQ for SSL Certificates in Utho Cloud Platform

## **1. What is an SSL certificate and why do I need it? ü§î**
An SSL certificate is a digital certificate used to establish a secure connection between a client (usually a web browser) and a server. It encrypts data to protect it during transmission and is necessary to ensure secure communication over HTTPS. Without it, sensitive data like passwords or payment details could be intercepted.

4. Fill in the required details (name, certificate content, private key, and certificate chain).
5. Save the certificate.

## **5. How do I update my SSL certificate if it expires? üîÑ**
When an SSL certificate is about to expire, you‚Äôll need to generate and add a new one:
1. [**Login**](https://console.utho.com/login)  to the Utho Cloud platform.
2. Navigate to the SSL Certificates [**Listing Page**](https://console.utho.com/ssl).

## **6. What happens if I don't renew my SSL certificate? ‚ö†Ô∏è**
If you don't renew your SSL certificate before it expires, your website or cloud resource will no longer be secure. Visitors will see warnings in their browsers about the insecure connection, and sensitive data transmitted between users and your server could be at risk.

## **7. How can I check the expiration date of my SSL certificate? üìÖ**
You can view the expiration date of your SSL certificate in the SSL Certificates [**Listing Page**](https://console.utho.com/ssl). Each certificate will display an "Expire At" field, showing the exact date and time the certificate will expire.
