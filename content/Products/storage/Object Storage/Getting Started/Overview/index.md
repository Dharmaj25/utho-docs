### What is Object Storage?

Object storage is a scalable and durable data storage architecture that manages data as objects, each containing data, metadata, and a unique identifier. Unlike traditional file or block storage, it is optimized for cloud environments, enabling seamless access and high availability.

### Purpose of Object Storage

Designed for storing unstructured data like images, videos, backups, and logs, object storage supports seamless retrieval, versioning, and large-scale data management, making it ideal for cloud-native applications, big data analytics, and disaster recovery.
