**Pull Count** refers to the number of times a specific container image has been pulled (downloaded) from the registry by users or systems. It provides insight into how frequently the image is being accessed or used in deployments, updates, or development environments.

2. **Monitoring and Analytics** : It can assist in tracking which images are actively being used and which may be outdated or underutilized.

* **Delete:** Click the **Delete** button to remove the repository from the container registory.
