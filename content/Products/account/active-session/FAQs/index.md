# Active Session

### 1. **What is an active session?**
An active session refers to an ongoing user connection to cloud services or applications, where the user is interacting with resources or performing tasks.

### 2. **How can I view my active sessions?**
Utho cloud platforms provide a session management dashboard where users can see details about their active sessions, such as device information, IP address, and session duration.

### 3. **How long do cloud sessions stay active?**
The duration of an active session depends on the cloud service's settings, such as idle timeouts or session limits, which may vary based on security policies.

### 4. **Can I have multiple active sessions across different devices?**
Yes, most cloud platforms support multiple active sessions, allowing users to log in from different devices simultaneously, though some services may have restrictions on this.

### 5. **How do I terminate an active session?**
You can log out or manually terminate active sessions through the cloud platform’s session management or security settings to prevent unauthorized access.

### 6. **What happens when an active session times out?**
When a session times out due to inactivity, the user is typically logged out automatically and will need to log in again to regain access.

### 7. **Are active sessions secure?**
Cloud providers implement various security measures like encryption, multi-factor authentication, and timeouts to protect active sessions, but users should follow security best practices as well.

### 8. **How can I monitor active sessions for security risks?**
Cloud platforms usually offer tools to monitor session activity, including logs that show when and where sessions are accessed, helping detect unauthorized or suspicious activity.

### 9. **Can I extend the duration of my active session?**
Some cloud services allow you to adjust session timeout settings or extend the duration of your session, depending on the platform’s policy and configuration options.

### 10. **What should I do if I suspect unauthorized access to my session?**
If you suspect unauthorized access, immediately log out of all sessions, change your password, and review security logs to assess any potential breaches.
