description: "A  **snapshot** is a point-in-time copy of a virtual machine (VM), disk, or volume. It captures the current state and data of the resource, allowing users to restore or clone it later. Snapshots are commonly used for backups, system rollbacks, and quick recovery after failures or changes."

# ðŸ“¸ Snapshots

## 1. What is a snapshot in cloud computing?
A snapshot is a point-in-time copy of a disk or volume, typically used for backup or recovery.

## 2. How do cloud snapshots differ from traditional backups?
Snapshots are usually faster and incremental, capturing only the changes since the last snapshot. Traditional backups often copy entire datasets.

## 3. Are snapshots incremental or full backups?
Most cloud providers use **incremental** snapshots to save storage space and reduce backup times.

## 4. How often should I take snapshots of my cloud resources?
It depends on your data criticality. Daily or hourly snapshots are common for production environments.

## 5. Can I automate snapshot creation and deletion?
Yes, most platforms offer automation through lifecycle policies or scripting with SDKs and APIs.

## 6. How much storage space do snapshots consume?
Initial snapshots take up full volume size; subsequent incremental snapshots only store changes, saving space.

## 7. Can I restore a VM or volume from a snapshot?
Yes, you can create a new volume or VM from a snapshot to restore your environment.

## 8. Are cloud snapshots stored in the same region as the resource?
Usually, yes. Some providers offer **cross-region replication** for disaster recovery.

## 9. How secure are snapshots in the cloud?
Snapshots are stored securely with options for encryption, IAM policies, and audit logs.

## 10. Can snapshots be encrypted?
Yes, most platforms allow encryption at rest, either using platform-managed or customer-managed keys.

## 11. Can I share snapshots between cloud accounts or regions?
Yes, but this depends on provider and permissions. For example, AWS allows sharing via permissions and AMI export.

## 12. Whatâ€™s the cost /associated with taking and storing snapshots?
You pay for the storage used. Incremental snapshots help reduce costs significantly.

## 13. How long should I retain snapshots?
Retention policies vary based on compliance and business needs. Automate retention for consistency.

## 14. Can I delete old or unnecessary snapshots manually?
Yes. Snapshots can be deleted via console, CLI, or API once they're no longer needed.

## 15. Do I need to stop my instance to take a snapshot?
No, snapshots can usually be taken while the instance is running, though consistency isn't always guaranteed.

## 16. Can I create a new VM or disk from a snapshot?
Yes. Snapshots can be used to create new VMs, disks, or instances for testing or recovery.

## 17. What happens if a snapshot is deletedâ€”does it affect other snapshots?
Only if snapshots are dependent. Most platforms handle deletion without data loss for other snapshots.

## 18. Do cloud providers guarantee data consistency in snapshots?
For file systems, generally yes. For databases, it's best to pause or quiesce I/O for consistency.

## 19. Are snapshots suitable for database backups?
Yes, but consistent snapshots require coordination with database processes.
