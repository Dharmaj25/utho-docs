## **Overview of Snapshots in Utho Cloud Platform**

A **Snapshot** in the Utho Cloud Platform is a point-in-time backup of a server instance’s state. It captures the entire system, including the operating system, configurations, and data, allowing users to preserve the exact state of their server. This backup can be restored at any time in the future, providing a reliable way to recover from failures or make copies of the server environment.

### **Common Uses of Snapshots**

* **Backup & Recovery:** Snapshots serve as backups, allowing you to recover a server instance to a previous state if something goes wrong.
* **Testing & Development:** Snapshots can be used to create safe checkpoints before making changes to your server, making it easy to revert to a previous state if needed.
* **Scaling & Replication:** Snapshots can be used to clone or replicate servers, creating an identical instance for scaling or testing purposes.
* **Disaster Recovery:** In the event of a system failure, snapshots provide a quick recovery option, minimizing downtime and ensuring business continuity.

### **Snapshots in Utho's Cloud Platform**

In Utho’s cloud platform, snapshots allow users to manage the state of their server instances through a simple and efficient interface. From the  **Snapshot Listing Page** , users can:

* **View** all available snapshots and their details, including the snapshot’s name, associated server instance, and creation time.
* **Restore** a server instance to a previously saved snapshot, recovering the server to its exact state at the time the snapshot was taken.
* **Delete** snapshots that are no longer needed to free up space and reduce storage costs.

This functionality ensures that Utho Cloud customers have an easy and reliable way to manage backups and disaster recovery, ensuring the integrity and availability of their cloud infrastructure.
