## **Overview of ISO Files**

An **ISO file** (or ISO image) is a digital copy of an optical disc, such as a CD, DVD, or Blu-ray. It contains the entire filesystem structure and data of the original disc in a single file, preserving all content and structure. These files can be mounted as virtual drives or burned onto physical discs when needed.

### **Common Uses of ISO Files**

* **Operating System Installation:** ISO files are widely used for installing operating systems on physical machines, virtual machines, and cloud servers.
* **Bootable Media Creation:** They help create bootable USB drives for system recovery, troubleshooting, or fresh installations.
* **Software Distribution:** Many software vendors distribute large applications and operating systems in ISO format to ensure data integrity and ease of installation.
* **Data Backup and Archiving:** ISO images allow users to back up important data, ensuring that the content remains unchanged and can be restored when needed.
* **Emulation and Virtualization:** In virtual environments, ISO files are used to install or test software without requiring a physical disc.

### **ISO Files in Utho's Cloud Platform**

Using ISO files in Utho's cloud platform enables users to deploy and manage custom installations seamlessly. Users can upload their ISO images, associate them with specific data centers, and use them for provisioning virtual machines or configuring servers. This eliminates the need for physical media, making the process more efficient and scalable.
