## Technical Questions

### How do I deploy a Kubernetes cluster using Utho's Kubernetes Instance?

To deploy a Kubernetes cluster:

1. Log in to Utho's dashboard.
2. Navigate to the "Deploy" dropdown and select "Kubernetes."
3. Choose your datacenter location, input the cluster label, and select the cluster version.
4. Configure the node pools (pool name, node size, desired count).
5. Review your configuration and click "Deploy."

### What is a node pool in Kubernetes?

A **node pool** is a group of nodes within a Kubernetes cluster that have the same configuration. Node pools allow you to manage groups of nodes with similar roles and resource requirements.

### Can I scale my Kubernetes cluster?

Yes, you can easily scale your Kubernetes cluster by adding or removing nodes from your node pools. Utho's Kubernetes Instance provides tools to adjust the size of your node pools based on your workload demands.

### What are the available authentication methods for accessing my Kubernetes cluster?

You can access your Kubernetes cluster using:

* **Password authentication:** Provide a password for accessing the cluster.
* **SSH key authentication:** Use an SSH key for secure and convenient access.

### How can I configure network settings for my Kubernetes cluster?

You can manage network settings, such as VPC configurations and firewall rules, through the Utho dashboard:

1. Navigate to the VPC section to view and modify network settings.
2. Use the Firewall section to manage firewall rules for controlling inbound and outbound traffic.

### What is the purpose of a VPC in Kubernetes?

A **Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** provides an isolated network environment for your Kubernetes cluster, offering enhanced security, custom network configurations, and efficient resource scaling.

### How do I integrate external tools and services with my Kubernetes cluster?

Utho's Kubernetes Instance supports integration with various external tools and services. You can use standard Kubernetes APIs and tools like Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for monitoring, logging, and managing applications.

## Troubleshooting

### What should I do if my Kubernetes cluster is not starting?

* **Check Logs:** Review the logs for error messages and troubleshoot accordingly.
* **Resource Limits:** Ensure that your node pools have sufficient resources (CPU, memory).
* **Network Issues:** Verify that your VPC and firewall settings are correctly configured.
* **Contact Support:** If the issue persists, contact Utho's customer support for assistance.

### How can I view and manage error messages in my Kubernetes cluster?

You can view error messages and logs through the Kubernetes dashboard or by using kubectl commands. Common issues and their resolutions are documented in the Troubleshooting section of Utho's Kubernetes Instance documentation.
